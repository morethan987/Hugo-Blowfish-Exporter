# Hugo-blowfish-exporter

## Summary
This is a simple plugin to convert your standard Obisidian md file to a Hugo-friendly format, especially the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme.

## How to use

1. set the output file path in the settings of Obisidian.

2. call the command palette and type `hugo`, then you can see the relevant command.

## Attention

Now the plugin only support a little function of Obisidian since it already cover my own usage.
  - callout(only three frequently used style and only for the blowfish: `note`, `warning`, `danger`)
  - inline math formular(the blowfish supports the code block)
  - mermaid
  - image insert(you should put your image into your hugo project folder manully)
